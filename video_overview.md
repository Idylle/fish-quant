We provide a number of video tutorials demonstrating how to use the various features of FISH-quant. Each section describes one aspect of the analysis.

**IMPORTANT** We update FISH-quant regularly to correct bugs or incorporate new functionality. Some of the **newer features might therefore not be captured in the video tutorials**. We try to indicate this in the description before the videos. Please also consult the user manual that describes the newest version of FISH-quant.


A PDF with a brief summary of the different tutorials can be found in the **Downloads** section. A more detailed PDF with a step-by-step description (Tutorial) can be found in the **Download section**.

In the different sections embedded videos are provided as well as links to youtube. For best quality use 720p and watch video in full screen mode.
