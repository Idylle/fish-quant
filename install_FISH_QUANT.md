  * A PDF with **detailed instructions** on how to install and use FISH-QUANT can be found in the **Downloads** section.

  * **Unzip archive** in user folder of Matlab. Under windows this folder is usually called something like C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB, where muellerf is the user name. In Matlab the user path can be found with the command _userpath_. There should now be a folder C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB\FISH\_QUANT.


  * **IMPORTANT** Before running FISH-QUANT the **Matlab path definition** has to be updated. Instruction on how to do this can be found in the above mentioned PDF.
